## Getting started

### When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen init` in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as
well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary
configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is
created, you're ready to go build out the package.
